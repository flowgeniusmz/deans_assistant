EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Even though learning in the academic areas is the primary purpose of any school program extracurricular activities are also an extremely  valuable area where students share accomplishments and learning experiences beyond those that occur in the classroom. A wide variety of  activities are available and we strongly encourage all of our students to become involved in one or more of them. 
A medical excuse restricting physical activity during physical education class will extend to any school-related club or activity which requires a  reasonable amount of physical activity. 
Our middle school attempts to accommodate the large number of students who wish to participate in athletic competitions against other schools.  Sports which can handle a large number of students such as cross-country wrestling and track are operated on a no-cut no tryout basis so that  all who wish to join may participate. Since only a limited number of students can participate in certain sports such as Boys basketball (5) Girls  
basketball (5) volleyball (6) or soccer (11) at one time a limited number of players are selected for these teams through a try-out process. To  help accommodate more students a seventh-grade team and an eighth-grade team are offered for Boys basketball Girls basketball and  volleyball. 
A wide variety of interscholastic sports is offered throughout the school year for students in sixth seventh and eighth grade. 
Fall Soccer…………………... Boys Grades 7 and 8 
Cross Country………….. Boys and Girls Grades 6 7 and 8 
Volleyball……………….. Girls Grades 7 and 8 
Winter Basketball………………. Boys Grades 7 and 8 
Basketball………………. Girls Grades 7 and 8

Cheerleading/Pom Pons… Girls Grades 7 and 8 
Spring Track……………………. Boys and Girls Grades 6 7 and 8 
Soccer………………….. Girls Grades 7 and 8  
Volleyball……………….. Boys Grades 7 and 8 
In order to participate in interscholastic athletics students must maintain academic eligibility as outlined in Section Four of this handbook. This  requirement is maintained so that parents and teachers are assured that involvement in interscholastic ath letics will not interfere with our students’  academic performance which as noted earlier is the primary purpose for their schooling. To participate in a sport or extracurricular activity a  student must have all fees (including registration fees book fines etc. for both current and prior years) paid in full or be current on their district  established payment plan. Students who are not in good financial standing will be allowed to continue to practice/rehearse but will not be allowed  to participate or dress for an event until the outstanding debt is resolved from Student Handbook 23-24.docx",thread_jemt4lAjqEtKGBj10JxIC3yG,msg_cKmAC9enYif4okffYfZaDDUF,run_NbR230jxQiPbkOfD8v0WSlBk,c612c07b-e0e1-4365-b1d8-a5df93c7f921,1709050196,2/27/2024 16:09,,,,,,,

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Even though learning in the academic areas is the primary purpose of any school program extracurricular activities are also an extremely  valuable area where students share accomplishments and learning experiences beyond those that occur in the classroom. A wide variety of  activities are available and we strongly encourage all of our students to become involved in one or more of them. 
A medical excuse restricting physical activity during physical education class will extend to any school-related club or activity which requires a  reasonable amount of physical activity. 
Our middle school attempts to accommodate the large number of students who wish to participate in athletic competitions against other schools.  Sports which can handle a large number of students such as cross-country wrestling and track are operated on a no-cut no tryout basis so that  all who wish to join may participate. Since only a limited number of students can participate in certain sports such as Boys basketball (5) Girls  
basketball (5) volleyball (6) or soccer (11) at one time a limited number of players are selected for these teams through a try-out process. To  help accommodate more students a seventh-grade team and an eighth-grade team are offered for Boys basketball Girls basketball and  volleyball. 
A wide variety of interscholastic sports is offered throughout the school year for students in sixth seventh and eighth grade.

In order to participate in interscholastic athletics students must maintain academic eligibility as outlined in Section Four of this handbook. This  requirement is maintained so that parents and teachers are assured that involvement in interscholastic ath letics will not interfere with our students’  academic performance which as noted earlier is the primary purpose for their schooling. To participate in a sport or extracurricular activity a  student must have all fees (including registration fees book fines etc. for both current and prior years) paid in full or be current on their district  established payment plan.

Signing In/Out 
To ensure our students’ safety it is extremely important that we can account for their attendance throughout the school day. We requir e students  who are tardy to school or need to leave school before the end of the school day to be signed in or signed out in the attendance office by the  person(s) dropping off or picking up the student. Students will be permitted to leave school if a properly authorized written request has been  presented or if a parent or guardian appears in person to withdraw a student from school. A photo ID is required. 
Reporting an Absence 
Absence Calls – When a student is absent a call should be made by the student’s parent or guardian to the school office to report the absenc e and  reason. Calls to report absences should be made between 7:45 and 9:45 a.m. Calls may be made before 7:45 a.m. to our automated attendance  line (refer to back cover). If an absence has not been reported by 9:45 a.m. the school is required by state law to make a reasonable effort to  contact the absent student’s parent or guardian to provide notification that the child is not in school. This reasonable effort to contact the parent  will consist of phone calls to the parent’s home cell and work numbers. 
Parents and guardians are required to notify schools and provide accurate and updated address and contact information. At l east two (2)  telephone numbers should be provided whenever possible. 
Absence Notes – If a parent or guardian does not report a student’s absence and the school office cannot reach them the student must present a  written note upon his/her return to school. This must contain the name of the student date(s) the student was not in school and specific reason(s) for the absence. It must also be signed and dated by the parent or guardian. This note needs to be turned in to the attendan ce office before school  the day following the student’s absence.

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Even though learning in the academic areas is the primary purpose of any school program extracurricular activities are also an extremely  valuable area where students share accomplishments and learning experiences beyond those that occur in the classroom. A wide variety of  activities are available and we strongly encourage all of our students to become involved in one or more of them. 
A medical excuse restricting physical activity during physical education class will extend to any school-related club or activity which requires a  reasonable amount of physical activity. 
Our middle school attempts to accommodate the large number of students who wish to participate in athletic competitions against other schools.  Sports which can handle a large number of students such as cross-country wrestling and track are operated on a no-cut no tryout basis so that  all who wish to join may participate. Since only a limited number of students can participate in certain sports such as Boys basketball (5) Girls  
basketball (5) volleyball (6) or soccer (11) at one time a limited number of players are selected for these teams through a try-out process. To  help accommodate more students a seventh-grade team and an eighth-grade team are offered for Boys basketball Girls basketball and  volleyball. 
A wide variety of interscholastic sports is offered throughout the school year for students in sixth seventh and eighth grade.

In order to participate in interscholastic athletics students must maintain academic eligibility as outlined in Section Four of this handbook. This  requirement is maintained so that parents and teachers are assured that involvement in interscholastic ath letics will not interfere with our students’  academic performance which as noted earlier is the primary purpose for their schooling. To participate in a sport or extracurricular activity a  student must have all fees (including registration fees book fines etc. for both current and prior years) paid in full or be current on their district  established payment plan.

Signing In/Out 
To ensure our students’ safety it is extremely important that we can account for their attendance throughout the school day. We requir e students  who are tardy to school or need to leave school before the end of the school day to be signed in or signed out in the attendance office by the  person(s) dropping off or picking up the student. Students will be permitted to leave school if a properly authorized written request has been  presented or if a parent or guardian appears in person to withdraw a student from school. A photo ID is required. 
Reporting an Absence 
Absence Calls – When a student is absent a call should be made by the student’s parent or guardian to the school office to report the absenc e and  reason. Calls to report absences should be made between 7:45 and 9:45 a.m. Calls may be made before 7:45 a.m. to our automated attendance  line (refer to back cover). If an absence has not been reported by 9:45 a.m. the school is required by state law to make a reasonable effort to  contact the absent student’s parent or guardian to provide notification that the child is not in school. This reasonable effort to contact the parent  will consist of phone calls to the parent’s home cell and work numbers. 
Parents and guardians are required to notify schools and provide accurate and updated address and contact information. At l east two (2)  telephone numbers should be provided whenever possible. 
Absence Notes – If a parent or guardian does not report a student’s absence and the school office cannot reach them the student must present a  written note upon his/her return to school. This must contain the name of the student date(s) the student was not in school and specific reason(s) for the absence. It must also be signed and dated by the parent or guardian. This note needs to be turned in to the attendan ce office before school  the day following the student’s absence.

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Even though learning in the academic areas is the primary purpose of any school program extracurricular activities are also an extremely  valuable area where students share accomplishments and learning experiences beyond those that occur in the classroom. A wide variety of  activities are available and we strongly encourage all of our students to become involved in one or more of them. 
A medical excuse restricting physical activity during physical education class will extend to any school-related club or activity which requires a  reasonable amount of physical activity. 
Our middle school attempts to accommodate the large number of students who wish to participate in athletic competitions against other schools.  Sports which can handle a large number of students such as cross-country wrestling and track are operated on a no-cut no tryout basis so that  all who wish to join may participate. Since only a limited number of students can participate in certain sports such as Boys basketball (5) Girls  
basketball (5) volleyball (6) or soccer (11) at one time a limited number of players are selected for these teams through a try-out process. To  help accommodate more students a seventh-grade team and an eighth-grade team are offered for Boys basketball Girls basketball and  volleyball. 
A wide variety of interscholastic sports is offered throughout the school year for students in sixth seventh and eighth grade.

In order to participate in interscholastic athletics students must maintain academic eligibility as outlined in Section Four of this handbook. This  requirement is maintained so that parents and teachers are assured that involvement in interscholastic ath letics will not interfere with our students’  academic performance which as noted earlier is the primary purpose for their schooling. To participate in a sport or extracurricular activity a  student must have all fees (including registration fees book fines etc. for both current and prior years) paid in full or be current on their district  established payment plan.

Signing In/Out 
To ensure our students’ safety it is extremely important that we can account for their attendance throughout the school day. We requir e students  who are tardy to school or need to leave school before the end of the school day to be signed in or signed out in the attendance office by the  person(s) dropping off or picking up the student. Students will be permitted to leave school if a properly authorized written request has been  presented or if a parent or guardian appears in person to withdraw a student from school. A photo ID is required. 
Reporting an Absence 
Absence Calls – When a student is absent a call should be made by the student’s parent or guardian to the school office to report the absenc e and  reason. Calls to report absences should be made between 7:45 and 9:45 a.m. Calls may be made before 7:45 a.m. to our automated attendance  line (refer to back cover). If an absence has not been reported by 9:45 a.m. the school is required by state law to make a reasonable effort to  contact the absent student’s parent or guardian to provide notification that the child is not in school. This reasonable effort to contact the parent  will consist of phone calls to the parent’s home cell and work numbers. 
Parents and guardians are required to notify schools and provide accurate and updated address and contact information. At l east two (2)  telephone numbers should be provided whenever possible. 
Absence Notes – If a parent or guardian does not report a student’s absence and the school office cannot reach them the student must present a  written note upon his/her return to school. This must contain the name of the student date(s) the student was not in school and specific reason(s) for the absence. It must also be signed and dated by the parent or guardian. This note needs to be turned in to the attendan ce office before school  the day following the student’s absence.

3. **Preventative Education and Support:**
   The document also mentions Erin's Law, which mandates sexual abuse and assault awareness and prevention education, and provides additional resources such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line for broader support related to crises and mental health [0].

It is crucial to take such complaints seriously and follow the steps highlighted in the document to ensure the student's safety and well-being, while also providing them with the necessary resources and support.

[0] Parents and students can report sexual abuse grooming behaviors and boundary violations to school or local authorities.  Call the 24-hour Child Abuse Hotline at 800-25-ABUSE (800-252-2873) if you suspect that a child has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed  by abuse or neglect. If you believe a child is in immediate danger of harm call 911 first. Your confidential call will not only make sure the child  is safe but also help provide the child’s family the services they need to provide a safe loving and nurturing home. 
In non-emergency situations anyone may report suspected child abuse or neglect using the new Online Reporting System. For more information go to https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/safekids/reporting/Pages/index.asp

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Even though learning in the academic areas is the primary purpose of any school program extracurricular activities are also an extremely  valuable area where students share accomplishments and learning experiences beyond those that occur in the classroom. A wide variety of  activities are available and we strongly encourage all of our students to become involved in one or more of them. 
A medical excuse restricting physical activity during physical education class will extend to any school-related club or activity which requires a  reasonable amount of physical activity. 
Our middle school attempts to accommodate the large number of students who wish to participate in athletic competitions against other schools.  Sports which can handle a large number of students such as cross-country wrestling and track are operated on a no-cut no tryout basis so that  all who wish to join may participate. Since only a limited number of students can participate in certain sports such as Boys basketball (5) Girls  
basketball (5) volleyball (6) or soccer (11) at one time a limited number of players are selected for these teams through a try-out process. To  help accommodate more students a seventh-grade team and an eighth-grade team are offered for Boys basketball Girls basketball and  volleyball. 
A wide variety of interscholastic sports is offered throughout the school year for students in sixth seventh and eighth grade. 
Fall Soccer…………………... Boys Grades 7 and 8 
Cross Country………….. Boys and Girls Grades 6 7 and 8 
Volleyball……………….. Girls Grades 7 and 8 
Winter Basketball………………. Boys Grades 7 and 8 
Basketball………………. Girls Grades 7 and 8

Cheerleading/Pom Pons… Girls Grades 7 and 8 
Spring Track……………………. Boys and Girls Grades 6 7 and 8 
Soccer………………….. Girls Grades 7 and 8  
Volleyball……………….. Boys Grades 7 and 8 
In order to participate in interscholastic athletics students must maintain academic eligibility as outlined in Section Four of this handbook. This  requirement is maintained so that parents and teachers are assured that involvement in interscholastic ath letics will not interfere with our students’  academic performance which as noted earlier is the primary purpose for their schooling. To participate in a sport or extracurricular activity a  student must have all fees (including registration fees book fines etc. for both current and prior years) paid in full or be current on their district  established payment plan. Students who are not in good financial standing will be allowed to continue to practice/rehearse but will not be allowed  to participate or dress for an event until the outstanding debt is resolved from Student Handbook 23-24.docx",thread_jemt4lAjqEtKGBj10JxIC3yG,msg_cKmAC9enYif4okffYfZaDDUF,run_NbR230jxQiPbkOfD8v0WSlBk,c612c07b-e0e1-4365-b1d8-a5df93c7f921,1709050196,2024-02-27 16:09:56

Signing In/Out 
To ensure our students’ safety it is extremely important that we can account for their attendance throughout the school day. We requir e students  who are tardy to school or need to leave school before the end of the school day to be signed in or signed out in the attendance office by the  person(s) dropping off or picking up the student. Students will be permitted to leave school if a properly authorized written request has been  presented or if a parent or guardian appears in person to withdraw a student from school. A photo ID is required. 
Reporting an Absence 
Absence Calls – When a student is absent a call should be made by the student’s parent or guardian to the school office to report the absenc e and  reason. Calls to report absences should be made between 7:45 and 9:45 a.m. Calls may be made before 7:45 a.m. to our automated attendance  line (refer to back cover). If an absence has not been reported by 9:45 a.m. the school is required by state law to make a reasonable effort to  contact the absent student’s parent or guardian to provide notification that the child is not in school. This reasonable effort to contact the parent  will consist of phone calls to the parent’s home cell and work numbers. 
Parents and guardians are required to notify schools and provide accurate and updated address and contact information. At l east two (2)  telephone numbers should be provided whenever possible. 
Absence Notes – If a parent or guardian does not report a student’s absence and the school office cannot reach them the student must present a  written note upon his/her return to school. This must contain the name of the student date(s) the student was not in school and specific reason(s) for the absence. It must also be signed and dated by the parent or guardian. This note needs to be turned in to the attendan ce office before school  the day following the student’s absence. 
An undocumented absence will result in a truancy absence.

assistant,"According to the student handbook for 2023-2024, students who are repeatedly tardy to class are subject to disciplinary action. It states that a student is considered tardy if they are not in their assigned seat when the class bell rings. Repeated tardy behavior constitutes a Level I offense. Students will receive three warnings per quarter for tardiness. After the third warning, the student will receive progressive discipline from the administration [0].


**Citations:**
[0] tardiness and other truancies will have a negative effect on the student’s overall classroom experience and grade. Time missed from school can  never truly be made up; the interaction in the classroom cannot be replicated by doing make-up work. According to the Illinois School Code a  
truant is “a child subject to compulsory school attendance and who is absent without valid cause from such attendance for a school day or  portion thereof.”  
State Mandated Time in Attendance 
What constitutes a full-day of student attendance?  
A full-day of attendance for students in grades 2nd through 12 must be a minimum of five clock hours (300 minutes) of instruction under  the direct supervision of:  
(i) A certified teacher or  
(ii) Non-teaching/Volunteer personnel when engaging in non-teaching duties and supervising those instances specified in Section 10- 22.34(a) and Section 34-18. 
What constitutes a half-day of student attendance?  
On a regular school day students in grades 2nd through 12 that receive less than 300 minutes of instruction but at least 150 minutes of  instruction can be claimed for a half-day of attendance. Students in grades 2nd through 12 that are not in attendance for at least 150 minutes  of instruction cannot be claimed. 
Tardiness 
A student is considered tardy if he/she is not in his/her assigned seat when the bell rings indicating the start of class. Repeated tardy behavior is a  Level I offense and is subject to disciplinary action. A student that arrives to school after 7:55 is considered late to school.

assistant,"The handbook outlines a **Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS)** and **Intervention Strategy** that can serve as a guide in managing crises, including those requiring special needs intervention:

### Intervention Strategy

- An intervention is a strategy or series of actions designed to positively affect areas in need of support.
- The process entails:
  - Defining the problem through questioning.
  - Explaining the reasons behind the current situation.
  - Setting expectations for the student.
  - Reviewing both successful and unsuccessful past strategies.
  - Designing interventions tailored to the student’s needs, which can include modifying classroom materials or developing additional social skills.
  - Determining methods for measuring the intervention's effectiveness.
  - Scheduling a follow-up meeting to assess progress.

- If results indicate the need for more intensive interventions, the possibility of special education services is considered. Parental permission is required for gathering additional information or reviewing existing information at this stage.

- Parents are informed of their rights. If the student is deemed eligible for Special Education Services, an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is developed [0].

Aside from the general intervention strategy, for situations that might involve a crisis of a mental health nature, such as thoughts of suicide, it's essential to know that there are immediate response resources available:

- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: Available 24 hours, in English & Spanish
  - 1 (800) 273-8255
  - 1 (888) 628-9454 (Spanish)
  - 1 (800) 799-4889 (TTY)

- **Crisis Text Line**: A 24/7 comprehensive suicide prevention text hotline, available by texting REACH to 741741 [1].

It's crucial to approach each crisis with sensitivity, understanding, and the appropriate resources or interventions. Always ensure the safety and well-being of the student while following the guidelines and protocols set forth in the handbook or your organization's policies.

Below is an elaboration on the general framework provided in the handbook, with specific adaptations for younger students:

   - For younger students, it's vital to observe and describe the problem behavior or learning challenge in simple, clear terms. Engage with the child using language and examples they can understand.

### 2. **Involve the Child in the Process:**
   - While younger children might not be able to articulate their needs as older students can, they can still provide valuable feedback through their reactions and behaviors. Engage them with yes/no questions, simple choices, and observations to gauge their preferences and challenges.

### 3. **Parental and Caregiver Engagement:**
   - This is crucial for interventions with younger students. Engage parents and caregivers in discussions, ensuring they understand the plan and how they can support their child at home. This partnership is vital for consistency and reinforcement of strategies across settings.

### 4. **Customize Classroom Materials and Activities:**
   - For K-2 students, this can include using visual aids, sensory tools, and manipulatives that align with their developmental stage and interests. Modifying tasks to reduce complexity or breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps can also help.

### 5. **Develop Social Skills and Emotional Regulation:**
   - Integrate activities that promote social interaction and emotional regulation into the classroom. Role-playing, social stories, and cooperative games can be effective. Teaching coping strategies and identifying emotions can also be part of the intervention.

### 6. **Regular Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - Young children's needs and abilities can change rapidly. Regularly assess the effectiveness of interventions and be prepared to adapt strategies. This might involve more frequent adjustments than with older students.

### 7. **Professional Collaboration:**
   - For students with special needs, collaboration with special education teachers, speech therapists, occupational therapists, and other professionals can enrich intervention strategies. These specialists can provide targeted support and strategies that complement classroom interventions.

### 8. **Focus on Strengths:**
   - Identifying and leveraging each child's strengths can be particularly effective in building confidence and engagement. Focus on what the child can do and their areas of interest as a foundation for development and learning.

### 9. **Plan for Transition and Follow-up:**
   - For younger students, transitions (e.g., from activity to activity or between grades) can be challenging and may require additional support. Plan these transitions carefully, ensuring the child understands what to expect and feels supported.

In sum, intervention strategies for K-2nd grade special needs students should be flexible, child-centered, and involve close collaboration with families and other professionals. By weaving these strategies into the framework outlined in the handbook, educators can create a supportive and effective learning environment for their young students.

assistant,"The handbook outlines a **Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS)** and **Intervention Strategy** that can serve as a guide in managing crises, including those requiring special needs intervention:

### Intervention Strategy

- An intervention is a strategy or series of actions designed to positively affect areas in need of support.
- The process entails:
  - Defining the problem through questioning.
  - Explaining the reasons behind the current situation.
  - Setting expectations for the student.
  - Reviewing both successful and unsuccessful past strategies.
  - Designing interventions tailored to the student’s needs, which can include modifying classroom materials or developing additional social skills.
  - Determining methods for measuring the intervention's effectiveness.
  - Scheduling a follow-up meeting to assess progress.

- If results indicate the need for more intensive interventions, the possibility of special education services is considered. Parental permission is required for gathering additional information or reviewing existing information at this stage.

- Parents are informed of their rights. If the student is deemed eligible for Special Education Services, an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is developed [0].

Aside from the general intervention strategy, for situations that might involve a crisis of a mental health nature, such as thoughts of suicide, it's essential to know that there are immediate response resources available:

- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: Available 24 hours, in English & Spanish
  - 1 (800) 273-8255
  - 1 (888) 628-9454 (Spanish)
  - 1 (800) 799-4889 (TTY)

- **Crisis Text Line**: A 24/7 comprehensive suicide prevention text hotline, available by texting REACH to 741741 [1].

It's crucial to approach each crisis with sensitivity, understanding, and the appropriate resources or interventions. Always ensure the safety and well-being of the student while following the guidelines and protocols set forth in the handbook or your organization's policies.

[0] Intervention Strategy  
• An intervention is a strategy or course of action designed to make a positive difference in the area support is needed. During the Multi-Tiered System of Supports discussion: 
o Questions to define the problem will be asked 
o Reasons will be explained 
o Expectations for the student will be determined 
o Successful and unsuccessful strategies will be reviewed 
o Interventions will be designed for the student’s needs. For example these interventions may include modifying classroom  materials or developing additional social skills. 
o Ways to measure the results of the interventions will be determined 
o Scheduling a follow-up meeting will occur

o If the results show that more intense interventions are needed a team may explore special education services. o In the event that special education services are to be considered parental permission is necessary to gather additional  information or review existing information 
o At this time parents will be informed of their parental rights. If the information shows that the student is eligible for Special  Education Services an Individual Education Plan (IEP) will be developed from Student Handbook 23-24.docx
